## Description

If you’re interested in learning how to **make your own third person action combat game**, like Dark Souls or Assassin’s Creed, then this is the course for you!

**Get in early for this exciting course**! The course is being developed right now, using the most up-to-date version of Unity - Unity 2022.1. You’ll be one of the first people to access the content, and your input could help shape the course!

Learn how to create your own third person combat system (like that used in games like Dark Souls or Assassin’s Creed). **It can easily be added to your RPG project, or any other third person game** you’re working on.

You’ll learn about player input, animation state machines, attack combos, dodging, target locking, cinemachine camera options, simple enemy attack AI and more.

By the end of the course, you’ll have created your very own sandbox arena where you can hack and slash as many enemies as you like, using a third person camera and control system - with either mouse / keyboard or game controller.

This course is aimed at a beginner plus to intermediate level. You'll need a basic understanding of the Unity interface and C# (if you've taken any of our other Unity courses then you should be good to go).

All students have access to the Q&A forums where our Instructors, Teaching Assistants and Community are ready to help answer your questions and cheer on your success.
